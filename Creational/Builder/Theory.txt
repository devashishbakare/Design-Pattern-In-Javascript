Imagine you’re ordering a custom-built computer.
You might start with a base model and then customize it by adding RAM, choosing a graphics card, and selecting a storage type.
Instead of passing all specifications at once, the Builder Pattern lets you create the computer step-by-step by specifying each part as needed.

When to Use It
When an object has a complex setup with multiple fields or configurations.
When you want to make the code more readable by organizing object construction steps.
When you want to allow different configurations of an object with varying combinations of optional fields.

The Builder Pattern solves the problem of constructing complex objects by separating the construction process from the representation.
This allows us to create objects step-by-step and gives us control over how each part is constructed.
It’s particularly useful when you have a class with multiple fields or when constructing an object requires multiple steps.
